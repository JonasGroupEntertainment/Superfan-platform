# Fan Engage Pro — Context Handoff for Claude Code

**Purpose.** Paste this file (or hand the path to Claude Code) at the start of a new session so the assistant gets a complete baseline before touching any code. Last updated 2026-06-15.

**Companion docs to read after this one:**
- `LAUNCH_CHECKLIST.md` (root) — single source of truth for migrations, env vars, and ship-blocking items
- `docs/AI_INFRASTRUCTURE.md` — the AI roadmap (20 features, 9+ shipped)
- `docs/LAUNCH_PLAN.md` — pre/post-launch task list with point persons
- `COLLABORATING.md` (root) — how Raymond and Kevin work in this repo
- `docs/ARTIST_AGREEMENT_RIGHTS.md` — legal-rights punch list

## 1. What Fan Engage Pro is

A multi-tenant fan engagement platform for recording artists. Members sign up for the platform, then join one or more artist communities. Per-community membership unlocks posts, events, rewards, leaderboards, and Premium ($-paid) perks. There is a sister product, **Brand Engage Pro (BEP)**, that runs the same code architecture for non-music brands (restaurants, retailers, hospitality). Most features ship FE-first then port to BEP via a "mirror bundle."

**Live URL.** `https://fan-engage-pearl.vercel.app` (custom domain TBD).
**Repo.** `KevinJonasSr/Superfan-platform`.
**Supabase project ID.** Stored in `reference_fan_engage_urls.md` memory.
**Hosting.** Vercel (Jonas Group org). NOT Render — disregard any error that says "DATABASE_URL missing in Render."

**Active artist communities (FE):** RaeLynn, Danger Twins, Dan Marshall, Hunter Hawkins.
**Inactive slugs to leave alone:** `nellies` belongs to Brand Engage Pro — do not activate it in FE.

## 6. Database — 36 migrations through 0036

All applied to FE Supabase except where noted in `LAUNCH_CHECKLIST.md`.

**Core (0001–0023):** Fans, points, tiers, badges, referrals, offers, purchases; community posts + reactions + comments; polls + challenges; storage buckets + 13 starter badges; campaigns + moderation; DB-backed artists + events + per-artist following; event RSVPs + reminders; legal policy_pages + consent + unsub tokens; notifications + fan-out; multi-tenant communities + admin_users + Street Team auto-enrollment; activate Danger Twins / Dan Marshall / Hunter Hawkins; Stripe subscriptions + founder cap; founder slot race-safe assignment; Premium visibility + tier helpers; 1.5× points multiplier wireup; cascade badge insert; founder-only tier widening; cancellation policy; rewards_catalog + redeem_reward RPC; community videos; **0023 fix_award_badge_delegate** patches a 42P10 mismatch that was silently breaking every signup since 0011.

**AI (0024–0032, 0036):**
- 0024 content_embeddings + pgvector
- 0025 moderation columns + RLS
- 0026 draft_used flag
- 0027 digest_log + fans.digest_subscribed
- 0028 community_posts.tags + GIN index
- 0029 event_match_log + artist_events.match_processed_at
- 0030 recommend_rewards_for_fan RPC
- 0031 community_posts.caption_used
- 0032 admin_briefs
- 0036 influencers + promo_codes

**Stickiness + polish (0033–0035):**
- 0033 music_outlet (multiple social platforms per artist as JSONB)
- 0034 founder_fan_badge
- 0035 focal_point (per-artist hero focal_x/focal_y)

**Schema gotchas:**
- `fans.id = auth.uid()` — they are the same UUID. Don't add a separate fan_id.
- `fan_badges` join is keyed on (`fan_id`, `badge_id`); use `award_community_badge()` RPC, not raw insert.
- `artists.slug` is the PRIMARY KEY — there is no `artists.id` column. Anything referencing an artist uses `artist_slug`.
- BEP equivalents have rename divergences: `offers` → `rewards`, `brand_events.detail` (FE: `description`), `brand_events.event_date` (FE: `event_at`), `notify_*_my_post` is singular in BEP, `notification_preferences.fan_id` is `member_id` in BEP. See `project_bep_smoke_findings.md` memory before porting FE→BEP.

### Launch readiness (per `LAUNCH_PLAN.md`)

Pre-launch and post-launch task lists exist with point persons in caps. Key remaining items:
- **G.4 — Custom domain** (fanengage.com or similar). George owns, Raymond + Kevin wire DNS + SSL.
- **G.5 — Onboarding wizard** at `/admin/<slug>/setup` (✅ shipped, still polishing)
- **G.6 — Stripe Connect** for artist payouts (pending)
- Asset gathering for all artists — Carla / Raymond / George (deadlines 5/12 for RaeLynn, 5/15 for others). Email scheduled.

## 8. Workflow conventions — read before any code change

**Bundle-based collaboration:**
1. I (Claude) edit files directly under `/Users/kevinjonassr/fan-engage` AND drop a tarball + `apply.sh` into the outputs folder as a backup.
2. Kevin commits + pushes from his terminal — the sandbox has a stale `.git/index.lock` and the deploy key has no write access.
3. Vercel auto-deploys on push to `main`.

**For migrations:**
1. Write the migration file to `/supabase/migrations/00NN_xxx.sql`
2. Apply via Supabase SQL editor (open via Chrome MCP — Claude can drive it)
3. Mark applied in `LAUNCH_CHECKLIST.md`
4. Commit the .sql file with the next code bundle

**Vercel Sensitive env vars:** `vercel env pull` returns empty for Sensitive vars; rotate to test, use hex-only secrets. See `feedback_vercel_sensitive_secrets.md` memory.

**Save retries:** Use the `useFormSave` hook on every write surface — it handles Supabase 503 retry + probe + status indicator.

**Schema parity:** FE feature ports to BEP need a column-name audit first. See `reference_bep_schema_map.md` memory.

---

## 9. Notable component patterns

- `<ImageUploader />` — wraps Supabase Storage upload, supports any bucket, returns public URL via `onUploaded` callback
- `<FocalPointPicker />` — click-to-set focal-x/focal-y on the artist hero (% values 0-100)
- `<ShareButton />` — Web Share API with copy-link fallback
- `<TagSuggester />` — AI-suggested tags chip row in composer
- `<CaptionSuggester />` — AI alt-text + caption on uploaded images
- `<CommentDrafter />` — AI-drafted reply with regenerate
- `<DropCountdown />` — drops_at / expires_at live countdown
- `<PredictionCard />` — vote + resolution badge
- `<WeeklyRecapTile />` — personalized fan recap on home

All admin forms use `<SaveStatusIndicator />` + `useFormSave()` from `lib/use-form-save.tsx`.

---

## 10. People and ownership

(See `reference_team_roster.md` memory for full roster.)

- **Kevin** — product + engineering, owns this session
- **Raymond Boyd** (`raymond@jonasgroup.com`, also `raymond@lyvcreative.com`) — engineering collaborator, super-admin granted, deploys + DNS work
- **Carla Moore** — operations + artist asset gathering, super-admin granted
- **George Kreis** (`george@jonasgroup.com`) — counsel + custom domain ownership
- **Leslie DiPiero** (`leslie.dipiero@jonasgroup.com`) — JG Publishing President (Dan Marshall conduit via Erin Mooring)
- **Lori Squires** (`loris@clarityconsultingsc.com`, Clarity Consulting SC) — RaeLynn point person

---

## 11. Open work — what's actively in flight or queued

**In progress (one task):**
- Task #312 — **Hotfix: onboarding email field readOnly trap.** Not finished. The `/onboarding` email field had a readOnly trap that blocks fans who arrive without a pre-filled value. Check `app/onboarding/*` and `lib/onboarding/*` for partially applied fix.

**Pending (from FE G-series):**
- **G.4** — Custom domain (owner: George; wiring: Raymond + Kevin)
- **G.6** — Stripe Connect for artist payouts

**Recent context (June activity):**
- Pre-commit hooks added (`.pre-commit-config.yaml`)
- Gitleaks config (`.gitleaks.toml`)
- GitHub Actions workflow added
- `RATE_LIMITING.md` policy doc
- Influencer + promo code migration (0036) shipped

**Things to NOT do without explicit ask:**
- Activate `nellies` — it belongs to Brand Engage Pro
- Reduce the Founding Fan badge bonus — team agreed it's a non-issue, NO change planned
- Add Apple SSO until the custom auth domain ships
- Mock the database in tests — integration tests must hit a real DB

---

## 12. How to use this in a Claude Code session

Paste the following at the start of the new session:

> "I'm picking up work on Fan Engage Pro. Read `docs/CONTEXT_HANDOFF.md` first, then `LAUNCH_CHECKLIST.md`, then `docs/AI_INFRASTRUCTURE.md`. The one in-progress task is the onboarding email readOnly hotfix — check there before anything new. Here's what I'd like to work on today: [your goal]."

Claude Code will then load the right files, follow the bundle-based workflow, and avoid the schema/workflow gotchas above.
